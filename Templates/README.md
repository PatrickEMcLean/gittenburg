# Things I find useful while writing.

I'm not a huge fan of rules. I especially don't believe in a slavish devotion to them. But a story (any story) is a very complicated things. Good stories work on multiple levels for multiple reasons. In fact, I think of a story as a set of interlocking systems. Character, Plot, Setting, Dialog, Description... pick your own set, but you can see how it gets frighteningly multi-dimensional, frighteningly quick. 

The old joke about stories is that there are only really five kinds of story, but nobody knows what they are. It's not exactly true. We know what they are, we just can't define them precisely. (And if that's too much of a paradox for you, maybe writing isn't for you.)

## How I use this stuff. 

I use these lists and questions and concepts as different filters to look at my stories through. They're kinda like checklists and they are kinda like lenses. Sometimes they really help me when I'm stuck. Other times...

Let's just say, your mileage may vary.
