This way of thinking about a screenplay/story was taken from the book "Save the Cat." You can find out more here [http://www.blakesnyder.com/](http://www.blakesnyder.com/) or just buy the book on Amazon [http://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009](http://www.amazon.com/Save-Last-Book-Screenwriting-Youll/dp/1932907009)

 [^1]: The scene in which the main character does something that we see as virtuous -- that gives us permission to like him/her/it. Not so important for books, because we can see into the character's head to understand why they do things. But boy does it screw up a movie if you leave this scene out. 

 [^2]: A way to deal with exposition. Have something really awesome and distracting going on while one character tells you things. For example, have a cardinal bring the Pope up to speed on a situation while the Pope is swimming in a pool. 

 [^3]: The defects we see in a character life or being that will be fixed by the end of the story. Doesn't have to be six things.
